# CSC207-Project

Description of the problem domain:
Our problem domain is Chess. Chess is a popular board game where the main goal is to capture the opponent's king. Each piece moves and captures opponent pieces in a different way. We are thinking of developing a chess app with both PVP and PVE capabilities. Where players can create a profile and play against either other players, or an AI. The profile will store some player data, such as PVP win rate, PVE win rate, overall win rate, total games played, etc. We will use a stockfish API for the AI that players will play against.

Link to the documentation for the API:

Screenshot of using the tool to try out the API: *Check hoppscotchScreenshot.jpg

Example output of running Java code: *Check APITesting.java

List of any technical problems blocking progress:
- Difficulty in looking for APIs and figuring out how to use them
